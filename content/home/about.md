My name is Han Jiatong, a third-year undergraduate from the National University of Singapore. I am an AI researcher, vastly interested in graph representation learning, recommender systems, parallel computing. My current work is to construct a knowledge-based course recommender system for university, supervised by [Prof. Kan Min-Yen](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/), co-advised by Ph.D. students [Lu Xinyuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinyuan-lu-34762585/?originalSubdomain=sg) and [Victor, Li Chuang](https://xiaowudeshen.github.io/about/). My recent goal is to seek to generalize our approach and make our model apply to other recommendation scenarios. I am open to research assistant positions, and potential 2023-24 Doctoral study opportunities.
